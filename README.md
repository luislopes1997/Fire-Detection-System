# Fire-Detection-System
Work developed for the course of Artificial Intelligence from Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico

In September 2nd of 2018 a huge fire consumed more than 93% of the National
Museum of Brasil collection, built over a period of two centuries. It is
believed that the bad condition of the electrical system was the major cause
of this tragic event. Moreover, there were plans to reform the fire prevention
system, which were not implemented in due time.
This mini-project addresses the problem of fire detection in a museum,
taking into account a simple fire propagation model and the uncertainty
associated with the fire detectors spread over the building.

# How to run the code:
In order to run the code just run on a terminal window `python3 solution.py Examples/<P*.txt>`, where `<P*.txt>` is one of the avaiable configuration files.
To check if the output is correct you can compare the generated file on exit with the respective solution in the folder `Solutions`.
